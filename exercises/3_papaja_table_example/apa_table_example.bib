  abstract = {On a recognition test, if presentation of a memory target (e.g., CAT) is used to prime-related distractors (e.g., ANIMAL, DOG), common sense and global memory theories expect that false-recognition rates will increase relative to unrelated distractors. However, counterintuitively, fuzzy-trace theory predicts that false-recognition rates will decrease and that, in some instances, related distractors will be easier to reject than unrelated distractors. In five experiments, this reversal of the usual false-recognition effect was observed for associates, category exemplars, category names, and rhymes. False-recognition reversals increased with age, with amount of target repetition, with degree of target priming, and decreased with length of retention interval.},

  abstract = {Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts False recognition in the Deese/Roedigerâ€”McDermott (DRM) paradigm has been shown to be greater following auditory study than following visual study, but there are competing explanations for this effect. We generalized this phenomenon in Experiment 1, finding an equivalent modality effect for associative (DRM) lists and categorized lists. Because conscious generation and subsequent monitoring of related lures during study is infrequent for categorized lists, this result is inconsistent with the idea that the modality effect is due to a study-based monitoring process. An alternative explanation is that visual study impairs relational processing relative to auditory study, which could cause a modality effect by lowering false recognition of related lures. We tested this idea in Experiment 2, by switching to a meaning-based test that is sensitive only to the retrieval of relational information. A modality effect was not obtained for either type of list on this test. The results from both experiments were predicted by a test-based monitoring account, rather than by the study-based monitoring or relational processing accounts.},
