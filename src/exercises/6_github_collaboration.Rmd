```

## Add collaborators

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Find one or two collaborators. Go to GitHub (or GitLab) and add each other as collaborators to your repositories.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 1", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
GitHub: `Settings > Manage access > Add people`

GitLab: `Project information > Members > Invite members`
```

## Publish changes without review

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
1. Clone your collaborators repository into a new directory (not inside your repository!)
1. Make some constructive changes
1. Stage, commit, and push all changes to your collaborators remote repository
1. Pull and review the changes your collaborator has made to your repository
1. Comment on one of the changes to your repository on GitHub
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
You may review the changes to your repository on GitHub or in R Studio. In RStudio, click the little clock icon in the Git pane to open the commit history and review the changes.
```

```{bash, box.title = "Solution 2", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
git clone
git add .
git commit -m "Constructive changes"
git push
```


## Create a "pull request" for review

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
1. Open two pull request (online and locally) to your partners repository
2. Review the proposed changes to your repository and request a change
3. If applicable, make the requested changes to your PR
4. Merge the updated pull requests to your repository

~~~bash
git pull
*git branch revision
*git checkout revision
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
*git push origin revision
~~~
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
Not really a lot to do here.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 1", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
Well done!
```

## Merge conflict

1. Together with your partner produce a merge conflicts on your repositories
    - Open a pull request (do not merge)
    - Make an edit to the same line on the main branch
2. Resolve the merge conflict
