abstract: |
  We investigated potential biases affecting the validity of the process-dissociation (PD) procedure when applied to sequence learning.
  Participants were or were not exposed to a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with two types of pseudo-random materials.
  Afterwards, participants worked on a free or cued generation task under inclusion and exclusion instructions.
  Results showed that pre-experimental response tendencies,
  non-associative learning of location frequencies,
  and the usage of cue locations introduced bias to PD estimates.
  These biases may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence of implicit and explicit knowledge.
  Potential remedies for these problems are discussed.

```

```{block, box.title = "Bonus", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-medal", box.collapse = TRUE}
Try the single-column single-spaced document style by using the `"doc"` class option.
```

```{yaml, box.title = "Bonus solution", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE, box.collapse = TRUE}
classoption: "doc"
```


## Citations

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Copy the introduction of the example manuscript into your document. Use the visual editor or the RStudio addin [`citr`](https://github.com/crsh/citr) to insert citations.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
Don't forget to add the bibliography file(s) to your YAML front matter.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 4", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
Add the the bibliography files to the YAML front matter:

<pre class="yaml">
bibliography: ["references.bib", "r-references.bib"]
</pre>

The following is an examplary excerpt of what you citations could look like:

<pre class="markdown">
One of the most frequently utilized paradigms in the field of implicit learning is the serial reaction time task (SRTT) originating from <span class="highlight">@nissen_attentional_1987</span>. [...] Even with more sensitive tests including the recently introduced wagering task <span class="highlight">[@dienes_gambling_2010; @haider_old_2011;  @persaud_postdecision_2007]</span> or the process-dissociation procedure <span class="highlight">[@destrebecqz_can_2001; @haider_old_2011; @jacoby_process_1991]</span>, explicit knowledge of the sequence is rare.
</pre>
```


## Report statistical analyses

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Locate and open the R-script `analyses.R` and data folder `data` accompanying the example manuscript in the folder `exercises/3_papaja_example_manuscript`.

Use `apa_print()` to report the results of one or more analysis using in-line code chunks in your **papaja** document.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
Use the section comments (e.g., `## ----setup----`) to split the R script into meaningful code chunks and use the section headings as chunk names.

You may omit parts of the R script that are not necessary for the analysis you are trying to insert into your document.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 5", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
The following is a minimal example of how to report one hypothesis test of one of the analyses.

<pre class="markdown">
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r setup}
# load packages
library("papaja")
library("afex")
&#96;&#96;&#96;

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r prepare-data}
acquisition <- readRDS("data/acquisition-task.rds")
&#96;&#96;&#96;

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r acquisition-rt}
# within the permuted-material group, high vs. low frequency locations can be distinguished
tmp.perm <- acquisition[
  acquisition$error == 0 &
  acquisition$trial > 1 &
  acquisition$included_participant &
  acquisition$material == "Permuted" &
  !is.na(acquisition$frequency),
]

permuted_aov <- aov_ez(
  data = tmp.perm
  , dv = "SRI"
  , within = c("block", "frequency")
  , id = "id"
)

<div class="highlight">permuted_res <- apa_print(permuted_aov)</div>&#96;&#96;&#96;

<div class="highlight">The effect of *frequency* was significant, &#96;r permuted_res$full_result$frequency&#96;.</div></pre>
```

```{block, box.title = "Bonus", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-medal", box.collapse = TRUE}
Add the corresponding plot that visualizes the results to your document.
```

```{block, box.title = "Bonus solution", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE, box.collapse = TRUE}
<pre class="markdown">
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r acquisition-rt-plot}
apa_lineplot(
  data = tmp.perm
  , id = "id"
  , dv = "SRI"
  , factors = c("block", "frequency")
  , dispersion = wsci
  , ylab = ""
  , args_lines = list(lty = c("solid", "solid"))
  , args_points = list(pch = c(21, 21))
  , args_legend = list(legend = c("High", "Low"), title = "Location frequency")
  , ylim = c(475, 650)
  , jit = .05
)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>
```


## Rendering tables

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 6", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Locate the section `proportion-correct-table-appendix` at the end of the R-script `analyses.R`.

Render the table of descriptive statistics for the generation task in your **papaja** document with `apa_table()`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
Use the arguments `col_spanners` and `midrules` to structure the table. To add a caption, use the argument `caption`. See `?apa_table`.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 6", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
<pre class="markdown">
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r proportion-correct-table}
tmp <- generation[
  generation$included_participant &
  generation$repetition == 0 &
  generation$post_repetition == 0,
]

# calculate proportion of regular transitions per participant
agg <- aggregate(
  formula = correct_SOC ~ material + generation + order + PD_instruction + id
  , data = tmp
  , FUN = mean
  , na.rm = TRUE
)

# calculate condition means and standard errors
means <- aggregate(
  formula = cbind(M = correct_SOC) ~ material + generation + order + PD_instruction
  , data = agg
  , FUN = mean
)
SEs <- aggregate(
  formula = cbind(`SE` = correct_SOC) ~ material + generation + order + PD_instruction
  , data = agg
  , FUN = se
)

# merge means and CI width
tab <- merge(means, SEs)

# bind Inclusion and Exclusion side-by-side
tab <- cbind(tab[tab$PD_instruction == "Inclusion", ], tab[tab$PD_instruction == "Exclusion", c("M", "SE")])
tab$PD_instruction <- NULL

tab$material <- gsub(tab$material, pattern = "-", replacement = " ", fixed = TRUE)
tab$generation <- as.character(tab$generation)
tab$generation[duplicated(paste0(tab$material, tab$generation))] <- ""
tab$material[duplicated(tab$material)] <- ""

<div class="highlight">apa_table(
  tab
  , row.names = FALSE
  , col_spanners = list(Inclusion = c(4, 5), Exclusion = c(6, 7))
  , midrules = c(4, 8, 12)
  , caption = "Means (M) and standard errors (SE) of proportion of correctly generated second-order
    conditionals (SOCs)."
  , placement = NULL
)</div>
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>
```


```{block, box.title = "Bonus", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-medal", box.collapse = TRUE}
Place the table in the appendix of your document. To start an appendix, use the following special heading:

<pre class="markdown">
# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}
</pre>
```

```{block, box.title = "Bonus solution", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE, box.collapse = TRUE}
<pre class="markdown">
\newpage

# References

::: {#refs custom-style="Bibliography"}
:::


\newpage

# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-}


&#96;&#96;&#96;{r proportion-correct-table-appendix}
apa_table(
  tab
  , row.names = FALSE
  , col_spanners = list(Inclusion = c(4, 5), Exclusion = c(6, 7))
  , midrules = c(4, 8, 12)
  , caption = "Means (M) and standard errors (SE) of proportion of correctly generated second-order
    conditionals (SOCs)."
  , placement = NULL
)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>
```


## Captions and cross-referencing

```{block, box.title = "Exercise 7", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Use a text-reference for your table caption and reference the table in the body of the text.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues", box.icon = "fa-lightbulb"}
Text reference definitions must be on their own line, surrounded by empty lines, and start with `(ref:reference-name)`.
```

```{block, box.title = "Solution 7", box.icon = "fa-check", solution = TRUE}
<pre class="markdown">
<div class="highlight">(ref:table-caption) Means ($M$) and standard errors ($\mathit{SE}$) of proportion of correctly generated second-order conditionals (SOCs).</div>
  
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r proportion-correct-table}
apa_table(
  tab
  , row.names = FALSE
  , col_spanners = list(Inclusion = c(4, 5), Exclusion = c(6, 7))
  , midrules = c(4, 8, 12)
<div class="highlight">  , caption = "(ref:table-caption)"</div>
  , placement = NULL
)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</pre>
```
