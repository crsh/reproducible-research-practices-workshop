# Defining reproducibility

As with (almost) everything in science, there are different definitions of reproducibility.
We will discuss some of them in the following.

---

# Defining dimensions

3-dimensional concept space

```{r, three-dims, out.width = "75%", echo = F}
include_graphics("./img/trr-cube.jpg")
```

# Defining dimensions

```{r, turing-dims, out.width = "75%", echo = F}
include_graphics("./img/turing_way_parts.jpg")
```
